This project implements a secure communication protocol based on the TCP protocol and the RSA cryptography algorithm.

Prerequisites
The code is written in Python 3. You must have Python 3 installed on your computer to run the code. Additionally, you must have the following Python modules installed: re, socket, subprocess.

Installation
You can simply clone the Git repository to obtain a local copy of the code.
